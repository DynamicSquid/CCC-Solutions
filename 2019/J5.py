"""
Basically we wan't to try out all the substitution rules
to see if we can generate the final string using the desired steps
given in the input.

We have 2 base conditions:
    1) If we have reached the desired number of steps AND the final seq
        - return steps recorded until then
    2) Else if we have reached the desired number of steps but have not matched
       the final seq
        - return False

Recursive Code:
(a, b) is our substitution rule:
We can find a in our seq using .find() to get the index and generate
new string with substitution rule and call recursive function.
